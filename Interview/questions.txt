OPEN TELEMETRY CONCEPT: 
is a vendor‑neutral framework (APIs, SDKs, etc.) for generating, collecting, processing, and exporting traces, metrics, and logs from apps and infrastructure.

GRAFANA: 
is an open-source observability and monitoring platform that lets you query, visualize, and alert on data from multiple sources through interactive dashboards.

Workflow
- You open a dashboard or run a query
- UI sends request to backend via REST API
- Validates permissions, forwards query to data source
- Data source (Prometheus, Elasticsearch, Loki, SQL) returns results 
- Grafana applies transformations and renders panels in the UI

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT BENEFITS:
- Centralized Artifact Storage
- Dependency Management
- Versioning & Traceability
- Integration with CI/CD
- Performance & Scalability

PROBE READINESS IN K8S:
is a health check that tells the kubelet whether a container is ready to accept traffic.

There are 3 types of probe readiness:
- Startup probe (waits for app to finish initializing)
- Readiness probe (ensures app is ready for traffic)
- Liveness probe (ensures app stays healthy over time)

CLUSTER IP IN K8S:
- It creates a virtual IP address that is only reachable inside the cluster
- It enables service discovery and load balancing for internal communication between components

HOW TO PROPAGATE THE CHANGE OF MODIFIED CREDS IN VAULT TO K8S POD:
Two concepts are used in enterprises:
- Vault Injector (Sidecar Pattern) -> better suited for apps that require live reload
- Vault Operator (Kubernetes-Native) -> better suited for helm based deploys

Vault Agent Injector (Sidecar Pattern):
- Authenticates to Vault using the Pod’s Kubernetes ServiceAccount
- Retrieves secrets from Vault and writes them to a shared volume
- Manages token renewal

Vault Operator:
- Pods mount these Kubernetes Secrets as usual
- Secrets still reside in Kubernetes, so RBAC and encryption-at-rest must be enforced

How you would upgrade K8s cluster with 0 run-time
1. Blue/Green Node Pools:
- Creates a new node pool (green) while keeping the old pool (blue)
- Workloads are gradually rescheduled from blue nodes to green nodes using taints/tolerations or node selectors
- If issues occur, you can reschedule workloads back to the old pool without changing cluster-level resources

2. Blue/Green Cluster
- Provision new cluster and replicate namespaces, RBAC, and policies.
- Deploy workloads and validate functionality.
- Switch traffic using load balancer or ingress routing.
- Retire old cluster after full cutover

DECLARATIVE VS IMPERATIVE IaC:
- Declarative -> you define the desired end state of your infrastructure, and the tool (Terraform) figures out the rest
- Imperative -> you provide step-by-step instructions on how to achieve the desired state.

AZURE CONCEPTS:
Fundamentals:
- Cloud Models (public, private or hybrid cloud)
- Service Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)

Architectural Components:
- Regions & Availability Zones
- Compute Services (Azure VMs, Azure K8s, Azure functions - event driven apps)
- Storage Services
- Networking
- Identity & Security

CONCERS FOR WRITING CUSTOM DOCKER FILES:
- Exposing sensitive info (creds)
- Privilege (containers by default run as root)
- Untrusted base images, dependecies

Provisioning tool what it means:
- Scaling
- Load balancing
- High availability
- Fault tolerance
- Storage orchestration
- Rollouts & Rollbacks
